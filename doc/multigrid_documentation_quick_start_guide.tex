\chapter{Quick Start Guide}\label{chapter:quick_start_guide}
The purpose of this section is to give you a brief introduction of how the multigrid is used in practice. It may suffice for the most applications.

\section{Installation}
There are two possibilities to incorporate the multigrid class in your program. First, you have to download the latest version of the multigrid class from	
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
https://github.com/tstollenw/multigrid
\end{lstlisting}
and unpack it somewhere. 
\subsection{Install as a library}
The recommended way is to install the multigrid class as a shared library. This is done in the following way.
\begin{lstlisting}
python configure.py <installation directory>
make
make install
\end{lstlisting}
The last command copies the library into the installation directory. If you do not have the necessary privileges, you may need to call
\begin{lstlisting}
sudo make install
\end{lstlisting}
instead. This will create a shared library \texttt{libmultigrid.so} and install it together with the necessary header file into the given installation directory.

\subsection{Direct use}
Alternatively, you could copy the files
\begin{lstlisting}
multigrid.cpp
multigrid.h
grid.cpp
grid.h
mesh.cpp
mesh.h
\end{lstlisting}
into your program directory and then include and link the files in the usual way. 

\subsection{Example program}
There is an example program \texttt{main.cpp} and will create an executable \texttt{example.out}. This is done by \texttt{make example\_lib} for the library installation or by \texttt{make example} for the direct use. All examples used in this documentation are part of the example program and can be found in \texttt{main.cpp}.

\section{First Steps}\index{Grid}
The numerical calculation of an integral over some function $f(\omega)$
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:integral}
	I=\int d\omega f(\omega)
\end{equation}
can be written as
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:nintegral}
	I=\sum_{i=0}^M d\omega_i f(\omega_i)
\end{equation}
where the $\omega_i$ is the discrete integration grid and $d\omega_i$ are the corresponding weights. The integration grid is a mapping from a discrete index $i\in\{0,\dots,M\}$ to a continuous variable $\omega_i$. The multigrid class provides both the integration grid and its weights (which are calculated by the trapez rule) as well as an inverse mapping (back from any $\omega$ to the nearest index $i$).

In the following we will show the basic functionality of the multigrid class by some simple examples. All these examples are more or less all part of the example program \texttt{main.cpp}. At first we will create a simple equidistant grid from $-4$ to $4$ with a resolution of $0.01$ by 

\vspace{1cm}
\noindent\begin{minipage}[l]{0.6\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
multigrid mgrid;
mgrid.add_gr_equi(-4, 4, 0.01);
mgrid.create();
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[]{0.4\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{pics/multigrid_00.eps}
\end{minipage}

\vspace{1cm}
After the declaration of the multigrid named \texttt{mgrid}, the member function \texttt{add\_gr\_equi} adds an equidistant grid region to the grid. The grid is created by invoking the \texttt{create} member function and it is accessed over its member variables (see table~\ref{tab:member}). 



\begin{table}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}\hline
		Name & Type & Description \\ \hline
		\texttt{M} & integer & Number of grid points\\\hline
		\texttt{omega} & vector & Grid (mapping $i\to\omega$ )\\\hline
		\texttt{domega} & vector & Weights of the grid\\\hline
		\texttt{omega\_min} & double & Minimum grid value (equal to \texttt{omega[0]}) \\\hline
		\texttt{omega\_max} & double & Maximum grid value (equal to \texttt{omega[M]}) \\\hline
		\texttt{inverse} & returns integer & Inverse mapping: $\omega\to i$ \\\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Most important members of the multigrid}
	\label{tab:member}
\end{table}

The calculation of the above integral from $-4$ to $4$ is then done by

\begin{lstlisting}
double I=0;
for (int i=0; i<=mgrid.M; j++)
{
	I += f(mgrid.omega[i]) * mgrid.domega[i];
}
\end{lstlisting}
where the trapez rule is used to calculate the weights \texttt{domega}.

\section{Logarithmically Dense Grid Regions}\index{Grid region!logarithmic}
To resolve steps or very sharp peaks in the integrand function one needs a lot of integration grid points at specific regions. The multigrid class provides a tool to solve such problems: logarithmically dense grid regions (LGR). An LGR is determined by four variables, i.e.~the center of the grid region $\omega_0$ which corresponds for example to the position of a peak in the integrand function, the half width of the grid region $\omega_1$, the maximal resolution $d\omega_{min}$ at the center of the grid region and the minimal resolution $d\omega_{max}$ at the edges of the grid region (see figure~\ref{fig:lgr}). 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pics/loggridregion.eps}
	\caption{Logarithmically dense grid region to resolve a peaked integrand function}
	\label{fig:lgr}
\end{figure}

It is created by the function \texttt{add\_gr\_log($\omega_0$, $\omega_1$, $d\omega_{max}$, $d\omega_{min}$)}. For example the following code adds a LGR on top of the equidistant grid region we used before. Note, that since the equidistant grid region was added first, it determines the outer boundaries of the whole grid (here from $-4$ to $4$). The first added grid region is therefore a special one and is called the basic grid region.
\\
\vspace{1cm}
\noindent\begin{minipage}[l]{0.6\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
multigrid mgrid;
mgrid.add_gr_equi(-4, 4, 0.01);
mgrid.add_gr_log(0.3,0.5,0.001,0.01);
mgrid.create();
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[]{0.4\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{pics/multigrid_01.eps}
\end{minipage}

The strength of the multigrid is that one can add now more and more grid regions on top of each other. The \texttt{create} function will take care of calculating intersection points between the grid regions by favoring the better resolved grid region. In the following example there are two intersecting LGR on top of an equidistant grid region. 
\\
\vspace{1cm}
\noindent\begin{minipage}[l]{0.6\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
multigrid mgrid;
mgrid.add_gr_equi(-4, 4, 0.01);
mgrid.add_gr_log(0.3,0.5,0.001,0.01);
mgrid.add_gr_log(0.6,0.5,0.001,0.01);
mgrid.create();
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[]{0.4\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{pics/multigrid_02.eps}
\end{minipage}

These are only the basic features of the multigrid class. There is an algorithm which decides where to cut grid regions if there is overlap or even skip a particular grid region in special cases. The decisive element is the grid resolution exactly at the center of a given grid region. Hereby it is possible to add hundreds of grid regions on top of each other without losing the resolution at every single center point of the grid regions. In figure~\ref{fig:multiple_lgr} there is an example for the necessity for multiple LGR in the integration grid. The integrand function has several sharp peaks which have to be resolved. Each peak is resolved by a LGR.
